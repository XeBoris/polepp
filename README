Input options
=============

The intention is to fill this file with info on each input option.
Not yet there though. Please contact me at fredrik.tegenfeldt@cern.ch in case of problems.

1. dmus  [Pole::setDmus(double d)]
	This is the stepsize in s (signal) when finding s_best - default 0.01

2. nbelt [Pole::setBelt(int n)]
	This gives the maximum n used for calculating the likelihood ration R(n,s).
	The minimum is always 0.
	It can be set to a fix value (e.g 50 is usually fine). Note that this needs to be increased
	if N_observed has a possibility of beeing above 50.
	If set to -1, the program will make the choice depending on N_observed.
	This is only useful when doing coverage studies where an optimised choice is
	of great importance.

3. hmin, hmax, hstep
	These are the min,max and step of test hypothesis for the limits.
	The defaults are (min,max)=[0,35] and step=0.02.
	Two things should be noted:
        A. The range (min,max) gives the maximum allowed limit range.
	   If, e.g, the upper limit reaches 35 with the default settings, it is time to increase the max.
	B. The step size gives the precision with which the limits are given.
	   The resulting limit will consist of values from the set given by (min,max) and step.

4. effdist, bkgdist
